# Multiplayer Tetris Game

## 🎮 Game Description

Where blocks fall, wallets cry, and only the brave survive! Every move is a race 🏃‍♂️ but you're also stuck together like awkward dance partners. 💃🕺

### The Paradox

Fight each other for the highest score while secretly hoping your 'opponents' help clear those pesky lines! It's like being frenemies with physics.

### The Stakes
